# Malware-Detection-using-Machine-learning
With the rapid expansion of the Internet, malware has emerged as a significant cyber threat. Any software designed to perform malicious activities, such as stealing information or conducting espionage, falls under the category of malware. According to Kaspersky Labs (2017), malware is defined as “a type of computer program designed to infect a legitimate user's computer and inflict harm on it in multiple ways.”

Despite the increasing variety of malware, antivirus scanners are struggling to provide adequate protection, leading to millions of systems being compromised. Kaspersky Labs (2016) reported that 6,563,145 different systems were attacked, and 4,000,000 distinct malware objects were detected in 2015 alone. Furthermore, Juniper Research (2016) forecasted that the global cost of data breaches would reach $2.1 trillion by 2019.

Moreover, the skill level required to develop malware has decreased due to the easy access to attack tools available online. The widespread availability of anti-detection techniques and the option to purchase malware on the black market have made it possible for individuals with minimal skills to become attackers. Studies indicate an increase in attacks by script kiddies or automated systems (Aliyev 2010).

Traditional malware detection methods, which rely on signatures, are becoming less effective as modern malware employs polymorphic techniques to evade detection. These malware programs frequently update themselves to newer versions, bypassing antivirus software.

Machine learning offers a solution by enhancing antivirus software's ability to detect new threats without relying on signatures. Previously, antivirus programs depended heavily on fingerprinting, which involved comparing files against a vast database of known malware.

The main issue with signature-based detection is its inability to identify malware that hasn't been previously encountered. This is a significant limitation given that hundreds of thousands of new malware variants emerge daily. In contrast, machine learning can be trained to distinguish between benign and malicious files by recognizing specific patterns, enabling it to detect malware regardless of whether it has been previously identified.
